### GitHub Basics and Version Control
Ukubona explained to Edward the basics of using Unix commands and GitHub, emphasizing that while GitHub offers free access, there are limitations on storage and features that encourage upgrading to paid plans. Edward confirmed he had created a GitHub account and discussed the importance of using GitHub for version control instead of email sharing. Ukubona advised Edward to explore the platform further and mentioned he would have access to detailed clinical scenarios that inspired their work.

### AI in Healthcare System Access
Ukubona and Edward discussed accessing a healthcare company's system, clarifying the process of navigating through the application to reach the energy section. Ukubona emphasized the importance of having direct access URLs for efficiency and explained the need for backend access for certain tasks. They also discussed the impact of ChatGPT's release on NVIDIA's valuation, highlighting the growing demand for AI and its role in decision-making processes. Ukubona concluded by explaining how AI could help in personalizing risks related to patient care.

### Personalized Risk Assessment in Healthcare
Ukubona discussed the limitations of communicating medical statistics to patients, emphasizing that averages can be misleading and personalized risk assessments are more appropriate. He explained that personalized risk calculations require a digital platform to handle complex variables and simulations, which is necessary for effective decision-making in healthcare and other domains. Ukubona also touched on the relationship between computational power and artificial intelligence, noting that advancements in AI often require significant computational resources and financial investment.

### Energy Demand and Price Trends
Ukubona and Edward discussed the relationship between energy demand, particularly in the context of technology companies like NVIDIA, and the resulting price increases in energy over the past 50 years. They planned to analyze historical energy price trends and explore the implications of increased demand for energy, which they compared to a tree within a larger ecosystem. They also decided on a meeting structure, distinguishing between random, unplanned communications via WhatsApp and regular, ritual meetings held weekly or bi-weekly, with the aim of discussing strategic matters such as grants and PhD applications.

### Meeting Structure and Strategic Planning
Ukubona and Edward discussed the structure and scheduling of meetings, distinguishing between unplanned, ritualized, and strategic meetings, with a focus on digital documentation and operational tracking. They explored the tactical and strategic implications of Edward's OPT status and potential PhD plans, emphasizing flexibility and the importance of aligning timelines with academic deadlines. Edward shared insights into his current status and future plans, while Ukubona highlighted the evolving nature of their collaboration and the potential for grants and strategic shifts.
